   - [README.md](README.md) - Project overview
   - [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design
   - [LICENSE](LICENSE) - Usage terms

2. **Check Existing Issues**
   - Look for open issues that match your interest
   - Comment on issues you'd like to work on
   - Avoid duplicate work

3. **Understand the Scope**
   - This is a proprietary project with educational use license
   - Commercial use requires explicit permission
   - All contributions must respect privacy and ethical guidelines

## üöÄ How to Contribute

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neuro-adaptive-music-player-v2.git
cd neuro-adaptive-music-player-v2

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/alexv879/neuro-adaptive-music-player-v2.git
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation improvements
- `test/` - Test additions/improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

### 3. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov black flake8 mypy
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

Follow these guidelines:

#### Code Style
- **PEP 8** compliance (use `black` for formatting)
- **Type hints** for all functions
- **Docstrings** for all public methods (Google style)
- **Comments** for complex logic

```python
def extract_band_power(
    self,
    data: np.ndarray,
    band: Tuple[float, float],
    method: str = 'welch'
) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Extract power in a specific frequency band.
    
    Args:
        data: EEG data of shape (n_channels, n_samples)
        band: Frequency band as (low_freq, high_freq) tuple
        method: Extraction method ('welch' or 'fft')
        
    Returns:
        Band power values for each channel
        
    Example:
        >>> extractor = EEGFeatureExtractor()
        >>> alpha_power = extractor.extract_band_power(data, (8, 13))
    """
    # Implementation
```

#### Testing
- Add tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

```python
# tests/test_features.py
def test_extract_band_power():
    """Test band power extraction with known signal."""
    extractor = EEGFeatureExtractor(fs=256)
    
    # Create 10 Hz sine wave
    t = np.arange(1280) / 256
    signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 10 * t)
    
    # Extract alpha power (8-13 Hz, should be high)
    alpha_power = extractor.extract_band_power_welch(
        signal.reshape(1, -1),
        band=(8, 13)
    )
    
    assert alpha_power > 0
    assert not np.isnan(alpha_power)
```

#### Documentation
- Update relevant docs for API changes
- Add examples for new features
- Keep ARCHITECTURE.md current

### 5. Run Tests and Checks

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Check style
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# With coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Follow conventional commit format:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add differential entropy feature extraction"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve NaN in bandpass filter for short signals"
# or
git commit -m "docs: update README with SEED dataset example"
```

Commit message prefixes:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `test:` - Test additions/improvements
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Thank you for contributing to advancing EEG-based emotion recognition! üß†üéµ

**Remember**: Quality over quantity. One well-tested, documented feature is better than ten half-finished ones.
