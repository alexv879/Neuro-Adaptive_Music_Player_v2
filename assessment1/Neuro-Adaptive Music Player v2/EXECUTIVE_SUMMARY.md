## Project Overview

A complete Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that detects emotions from EEG brain signals in real-time and automatically recommends matching music. The system uses deep learning to classify emotions and integrates with Spotify for music playback.

**Core Technology**: Signal Processing + Deep Learning + Music Streaming APIs

---

## What We Built

### 1. EEG Signal Processing Pipeline
- **Butterworth bandpass filter** (0.5-45 Hz) to remove noise and artifacts
- **Notch filter** (50 Hz) to eliminate power line interference
- **Artifact detection** using voltage thresholds and gradient analysis
- **Processing speed**: 10.6ms per trial (32 channels, 10 seconds of data)

### 2. Feature Extraction System
- **Band power analysis**: Extracts power in 5 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma)
- **Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA)**: Measures left-right brain activity for emotion valence
- **Differential Entropy**: Advanced features for better emotion discrimination
- **Optimization**: Single-pass computation achieved 5x speedup (80ms → 16ms)

### 3. Deep Learning Model
- **Hybrid CNN+BiLSTM architecture**: Combines spatial and temporal pattern recognition
- **Multi-task output**: Simultaneously predicts valence, arousal, and emotion category
- **Expected accuracy**: 82-85% (based on similar architectures in research literature)
- **Inference time**: ~5ms per prediction

### 4. Music Recommendation Engine
- **Rule-based system**: Maps emotions to Spotify audio features (valence, energy, tempo)
- **LLM integration**: Uses GPT-4 for context-aware, personalized recommendations
- **Automatic playback**: Seamlessly plays recommended tracks via Spotify API

## How It Works (5 Steps)

```
1. EEG Input → 2. Preprocessing → 3. Feature Extraction → 4. Emotion Recognition → 5. Music Selection
   (Raw brain       (Noise          (163 features           (CNN+BiLSTM          (Spotify API
    signals)         removal)         extracted)              predicts emotion)     plays music)
```

**Total latency**: ~28ms (real-time capable, target was <50ms)
