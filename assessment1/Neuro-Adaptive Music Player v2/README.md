### Training a Model

```python

import numpy as np

# Load your dataset
X_train = np.load('X_train.npy')  # Shape: (n_samples, n_features)
y_train = np.load('y_train.npy')  # Labels: ['happy', 'sad', 'relaxed', ...]

# Create and train model
model = EmotionRecognitionModel(
    input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],),
    n_classes=5,
    model_name='my_emotion_model'
)
model.build_model(architecture='cnn_bilstm')
model.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Save trained model

```

### Real-Time Processing

```python
from src.eeg_preprocessing import EEGPreprocessor
from src.eeg_features import EEGFeatureExtractor
import time

preprocessor = EEGPreprocessor()
extractor = EEGFeatureExtractor()

while True:
    # Get live EEG window (implement your hardware interface)
    eeg_window = get_live_eeg_data()  # Shape: (n_channels, 512)
    
    # Process
    clean = preprocessor.preprocess(eeg_window)
    features = extractor.extract_all_features(clean, channel_names)
    feature_vec = extractor.features_to_vector(features)
    
    # Predict emotion
    emotion = model.predict(feature_vec.reshape(1, -1))
    
    # Adapt music based on emotion
    adapt_music(emotion[0])
    
    time.sleep(0.5)  # 2 Hz update rate
```

### Batch Processing Dataset

from src.eeg_features import EEGFeatureExtractor
import numpy as np

# Load dataset (e.g., DEAP)
eeg_data = np.load('deap_preprocessed.npy')  # (n_trials, n_channels, n_samples)

# Extract features for all trials
extractor = EEGFeatureExtractor()
features = extractor.extract_features_batch(
    eeg_data,
    channel_names=channel_names,
    window_data=False  # Extract from entire trial
)

print(f"Feature matrix shape: {features.shape}")
# Save for model training
np.save('deap_features.npy', features)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Import numpy could not be resolved"
**Solution**: Install numpy: `pip install numpy`

### Issue: "TensorFlow not available"
**Solution**: Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow>=2.10.0`

### Issue: "Filter produces NaN values"
**Solution**: Check input data for NaN/Inf, ensure sufficient data length (>3× filter order)

### Issue: "Model accuracy is low"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure proper preprocessing (bandpass + notch)
- Check data quality (use `check_data_quality()`)
- Verify channel names match FAA pairs
- Try data augmentation
- Increase training epochs

## Performance Optimization

### For Real-Time Applications
1. Use FFT instead of Welch for band power (2.4x faster)
2. Reduce window overlap (0.25 instead of 0.5)
3. Use CNN-only model (no BiLSTM)
4. Process on GPU if available

### For Batch Processing
1. Use Welch method for better accuracy
2. Enable data augmentation
3. Use full CNN+BiLSTM model
4. Process multiple files in parallel
