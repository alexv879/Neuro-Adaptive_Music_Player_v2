import numpy as np

# Load your dataset
X_train = np.load('X_train.npy')  # Shape: (n_samples, n_features)
y_train = np.load('y_train.npy')  # Labels: ['happy', 'sad', 'relaxed', ...]

# Create and train model

    # Process
    clean = preprocessor.preprocess(eeg_window)
    features = extractor.extract_all_features(clean, channel_names)
    feature_vec = extractor.features_to_vector(features)
    
    # Predict emotion
    emotion = model.predict(feature_vec.reshape(1, -1))
    
    # Adapt music based on emotion

extractor = EEGFeatureExtractor()
features = extractor.extract_features_batch(
    eeg_data,
    channel_names=channel_names,
    window_data=False  # Extract from entire trial
)

print(f"Feature matrix shape: {features.shape}")
# Save for model training
np.save('deap_features.npy', features)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Import numpy could not be resolved"
**Solution**: Install numpy: `pip install numpy`

### Issue: "TensorFlow not available"
**Solution**: Install TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow>=2.10.0`

### Issue: "Filter produces NaN values"
**Solution**: Check input data for NaN/Inf, ensure sufficient data length (>3× filter order)

### Issue: "Model accuracy is low"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure proper preprocessing (bandpass + notch)
- Check data quality (use `check_data_quality()`)
- Verify channel names match FAA pairs
- Try data augmentation
- Increase training epochs

## Performance Optimization

### For Real-Time Applications
1. Use FFT instead of Welch for band power (2.4x faster)
2. Reduce window overlap (0.25 instead of 0.5)
3. Use CNN-only model (no BiLSTM)
4. Process on GPU if available

### For Batch Processing
1. Use Welch method for better accuracy
2. Enable data augmentation
3. Use full CNN+BiLSTM model
4. Process multiple files in parallel
